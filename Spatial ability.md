#Spatial ability 
Spatial ability is the capacity to understand and remember the spatial relations among objects. In a spatial ability test (also called spatial reasoning test) you are required to mentally manipulate 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional figures.

## What questions can I expect?
The questions found in a spatial ability test are often of a similar nature. Here's a list of the most common question types:

## Cubes: 
You are given a flat (2-dimensional) pattern which can be folded into a cube. Amongst a number of 3-dimensional cubes you are to choose the one that 2-D pattern can be folded into.

## Paper folding: 
In the question you are shown a paper being folded in steps. A hole is then punched one or more places through the folded paper. You are to find the answer option that correctly shows how the paper would look after being unfolded.

## 2-D rotating figures:
The question image is a drawn figure of some type. You are to find the figure that, after being rotated, is exactly the same as the figure in the question image.

## 3-D rotating objects:
The question image is a 3-dimensional object. You are to find the object that, after being rotated, is exactly the same as the object in the question image.

## Mirroring:
You are given a drawn figure in the question. You must find the answer that is a mirror image of the question figure. Mirroring can be both vertically and horizontally.

## Assembling objects:
You are given four or more parts of an object. You have to find the object that can be built with the parts. These questions can be either 3-dimensional or 2-dimensional.

## Where are Spatial Ability tests used?
Spatial ability tests are used as part of the recruitment process of engineers, architects, chemists, mechanics, line assembly workers, and more. The tests are often a part of the school admission exam for education as architects, graphic designers, air traffic controllers, pilots, and more.
